# Hi, I'm Sargun!

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

<div class="intro" markdown="1">
I am a **Master's in Data Science** student at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu) and bring 3+ years of hands-on experience specializing in **Machine Learning and NLP**. As a Data Science Intern at [Marsh McLennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_McLennan) (NY), I led the development of an impactful industry benchmarking pipeline, leveraging LLMs, Clustering, and Hypothesis Testing, showcasing my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights for business stakeholders.

Preceding my Masterâ€™s, I spent 2 years as a **Data Scientist** at [Fidelity Investments](https://fcatalyst.com/overview), pioneering data products that saved time and money for financial advisors and analysts. My contributions spanned Document Information Extraction, Text Summarization, and Email Fraud Detection.

I love working on data for social good projects and as a **Research Engineer**, I published research papers on Statistics and ML for COVID-19 caseload prediction and devising interventions to mitigate infection outbreaks.

<!-- <div class="intro" markdown="1">
I am currently pursuing my **Master's in Data Science** at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu), graduating in May 2024. I have **3+ years** of experience in Data Science, specializing in building **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing** products.

In the summer, I interned at [Marsh McLennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_McLennan) (NY) as a Data Science Intern, working on peer grouping of insurance clients based on their claims data, leveraging LLMs, Clustering, and Hypothesis Testing.

Prior to my Master's, I worked as a **Data Scientist** for 2 years at [Fidelity Investments](https://fcatalyst.com/overview), developing solutions for Document Information Extraction, Text Summarization, Email Fraud Detection, Explainable AI and more.

In addition, I have 1 year of experience conducting research in the area of **ML for social good**. As a **Research Scientist** at [ML2CT Lab, Ashoka](https://ashoka.edu.in/ML2CT), I worked on the statistical modelling of contact mixing patterns to devise interventions to limit the spread of infectious diseases. At [TavLab, IIIT-Delhi](http://tavlab.iiitd.edu.in/), I used ML to build predictive models for COVID-19 caseload predicion and surveillance of emerging variants.
