description: Master's experience and life at NYU

I completed my first semester at NYU Center for Data Science and feel proud of my decision to come here to pursue my Master's. I shattered my own barriers of what I thought could be learned in a really short span of time, and put my heart out to learn (and had real fun doing it too!)

Each course was a perfect blend of theory and applications. 
For example, in the Probability course, the following topics were paired: Basic Probability - Monte Carlo simulation, Discrete distributions - Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Continuous distributions -  Inverse Transform Sampling, Joint Distributions - Causal Inference and Bayesian parametric modeling.

In Linear Algebra, we started from the basics of vector spaces, linear transformations and eigenvectors and built up to how these concepts are used in PCA, SVD, Spectral clustering on Graphs, Regression, and Convex optimization.

Apart from academics, I learnt to cook (something I was not accustomed to as an international student), manage my own home and find things to keep myself happy.

Hoping to make the most out of my time at CDS and looking forward to the semester ahead!
