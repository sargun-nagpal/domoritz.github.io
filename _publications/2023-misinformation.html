Background: The COVID-19 Infodemic had an unprecedented impact on health behaviors
and outcomes at a global scale. While many studies have focused on a qualitative and
quantitative understanding of misinformation, including sentiment analysis, there is a gap in
understanding the emotion-carriers of misinformation and their differences across
geographies. In this study, we characterized emotion carriers and their impact on vaccination
rates in India and the United States. Our large language model was trained on 2.3 million
tweets carrying COVID-19 misinformation and validated prospectively on a manually
annotated set of 2000 misinformation tweets across the globe.

Methods: A manually labelled dataset was created and collated with three publicly available
datasets (CoAID, AntiVax, CMU) to train deep learning models for misinformation
classification. Misinformation labelled tweets were further analyzed for behavioral aspects by
leveraging Plutchik Transformers to determine the emotion for each tweet. Time series
analysis was conducted to study the impact of misinformation on spatial and temporal
characteristics. Further, categorical classification was performed using transformer models to
assign categories (Authority, Symptoms, Cure, Vaccination and Spread) for the
misinformation tweets.

Findings: Word2Vec+BiLSTM was the best model for misinformation classification, with an
F1-score of 0.92. The US had the highest proportion of misinformation tweets (58.02%),
followed by the UK (10.38%) and India (7.33%). Disgust, anticipation, and anger were
associated with an increased prevalence of misinformation tweets. Disgust was the
predominant emotion associated with misinformation tweets in the US, while anticipation
was the predominant emotion in India. For India, the misinformation rate exhibited a lead
relationship with vaccination, while in the US it lagged behind vaccination.
Interpretation: Our study deciphered that emotions acted as differential carriers of
misinformation across geography and time. These carriers can be monitored to develop
strategic interventions for countering misinformation, leading to improved public health.
