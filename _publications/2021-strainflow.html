The global efforts to control COVID-19 are threatened by the rapid emergence of novel
SARS-CoV-2 variants that may display undesirable characteristics such as immune escape or
increased pathogenicity. Early prediction of emerging strains could be vital to pandemic
preparedness but remains an open challenge. Here, we developed Strainflow, to learn the
latent dimensions of 0.9 million high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and used
machine learning algorithms to predict upcoming caseloads of SARS-CoV-2. In our
Strainflow model, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were treated as documents, and codons as
words to learn unsupervised codon embeddings (latent dimensions). We discovered that
codon-level changes lead to a change in the entropy of the latent dimensions. We used a
machine learning algorithm to find the most relevant latent dimensions called Dimensions of
Concern (DoCs) of SARS-CoV-2 spike genes, and demonstrate their potential to provide a
lead time for predicting new caseloads in several countries. The DoCs capture codons
associated with global Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs), and may
be surveilled to predict country-specific emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
